# ðŸ’¬ Chat Server

Chat Server is a muti-threaded socket server used in [Chat-Client](https://github.com/N19htw1n9/Chat-Client) to create connections, and handle chat data. Chat Server is written in Java and uses the `java.net.Socket` library to build Socket connections.

Chat Server is also multi-threaded and creates a new thread for every new connection and handles these connections in an efficient manner.<br />
